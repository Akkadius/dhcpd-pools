.SH NAME
dhcpd-pools \- ISC dhcpd pools usage analysis
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dhcpd-pools
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The program analyses ISC dhcpd shared network and pool usage and outputs the
results in a format selected by user.
.SH OUTPUT FIELDS
.TP
.I "shared net name"
Name of the shared-network for the range.
.TP
.I "first ip"
First IP in lease pool range.
.TP
.I "last ip"
Last IP in lease pool range.
.TP
.I "max"
Number of IPs which exist in a pool, shared network or all together.
.TP
.I "cur"
Number of leases currently in use.
.TP
.I "percent"
Percent of IPs currently in use compared to max.
.TP
.I "touch"
Number of IP's which appear in the lease file, but who's leases have expired.
A touched IP is either expired or abandoned.  The touched IP count is
somewhat misleading when you try to determine if an IP pool is big enough; it
is a better indicator of whether a pool is too large.
.TP
.I "t+c"
The sum of Touched and Currently in-use leases.
.TP
.I "t+c perc"
Percent of IPs either touched or currently in use, compared to max.
.TP
.I "bu"
Failover pair can allocate these addresses.  The count appears only if there
is failover configuration.
.TP
.I "bu perc"
Percent of addresses that failover pair can allocate.  The percent appears
only if there is failover configuration.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Path to the dhcpd.conf file.  If the dhcpd.conf has include files they
can be analysed separately, that can be useful when trying to understand
or monitor subset of data.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-leases\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Path to the dhcpd.leases file.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sort\fR=\fI[nimcptTe]\fR
Sort ranges by chosen fields as a sorting keys.  Maximum of five sort keys
can be defined.  Keys weight from left to right, i.e., if more weighting keys
are equal next one is used.  The IP field is default sort key.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reverse\fR
Sort results in reverse order.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR=\fI[thHcxXjJ]\fR
Output format.
Text
.RI ( t ).
Standard html
.RI ( h )
outputs only the HTML tables, and is useful for embedding more complex web
pages.  Full-html
.RI ( H )
provides complete HTML headers, etc., including in-line CSS.  The
.RI ( c )
stands for comma-separated values.  Output format xml
.RI ( x )
is similar to the dhcpstatus Perl module output.  The extended xml
.RI ( X )
format will print ethernet address details.  The
.RI ( j )
will output in json format, which can be extended with
.RI ( J )
to include ethernet address.
.IP
The default format is
.IR @OUTPUT_FORMAT@ .
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIFILE\fR
.I File
where output is written.  Default is stdout.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR=\fINR\fR
The
.I NR
will limit what will be printed.  Syntax is similar to
.IR chmod (1)
permission string.  The
.I NR
limit string uses two digits which vary between
.IR 0 \ to \ 7 .
The first digit determines which headers to display, and the second digit
determines which numeric analysis tables to include in the output.  The
following values are "OR'd" together to create the desired output.  The
default is
.IR @OUTPUT_LIMIT@ .
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B 01
Print ranges
.TP
.B 02
Print shared networks
.TP
.B 04
Print total summary
.TP
.B 10
Print range header
.TP
.B 20
Print shared network header
.TP
.B 40
Print total summary header
.PD
.RE
.IP
The output limit for total summary has special meaning in
.B \-\-warning
and
.B \-\-critical
alarming context.  When the alarming is in use, and total is not wanted
to be seen then in the case of alarming returning success nothing is
printed.
.TP
\fB\-\-warning\fR=\fIpercent\fR
Turn on alarm output format, and specify percentage number which will
cause an alarm.  If either a range or shared network will exceed
warning level return value of the command is
.BR 1 .
If only range monitoring is needed one can use limit option for scoping,
for example
.IR \-L10 .
To monitor shared network only the limit would be
.IR \-L20 .
If warning percentage is not specified it defaults to
.BR @ALARM_WARN@ .
The
.I percent
argument allows fractions, e.g., 88.8, to be used.
.TP
\fB\-\-critical\fR=\fIpercent\fR
The option is similar to warning, with exception of return value which
is
.BR 2 .
If critical percentage is not specified it defaults to
.BR @ALARM_CRIT@ .
.TP
\fB\-\-minsize\fR=\fIsize\f
Ignore ranges and shared networks that are smaller or equal to the
defined size.  This option is meaningful only in context of alarming, and
will intented to supress for example single host ranges.  By default this
option is not in use.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information to standard output and exit successfully.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help to standard output and exit successfully.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Print ranges header, and analysis.
$ dhcpd-pools \-L 11 \-c dhcpd.conf \-l dhcpd.leases
.br
Ranges:
.br
shared net name [...]
.TP
Print shared networks and totals, both headers and results
$ dhcpd-pools \-L 66 \-c dhcpd.conf \-l dhcpd.leases shared net name
.br

.TP
Alarming
$ dhcpd-pools \-c dhcpd.conf \-l dhcpd.leases \-\-critical 80.1 \-\-warning 75
.br
CRITICAL: dhcpd-pools: Ranges; crit: 14 warn: 22 ok: 220 Shared nets; crit: 1 warn: 0 ok: 4
.IP
$ dhcpd-pools \-c dhcpd.conf \-l dhcpd.leases \-L 22 \-\-critical 70 \-\-warning 50
.br
[no-output]
.br
Supress printing OK, and make alarm only to go off if shared networks
exceed critial or warning levels.
