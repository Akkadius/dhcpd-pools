.TH DHCPD-POOLS "1" "June 2011" "dhcpd-pools 2.15" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
dhcpd-pools \- ISC dhcpd pools usage analysis
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dhcpd-pools
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The program analyses ISC dhcpd shared network and pool usage and outputs the
results in a user selectable format.
.SH FIELDS
.TP
.I "shared net name"
Name of the shared-network for the range.
.TP
.I "first ip"
First IP in lease pool range.
.TP
.I "last ip"
Last IP in lease pool range.
.TP
.I "max"
Number of IPs which exist in a pool, shared network or all together.
.TP
.I "cur"
Number of leases currently in use.
.TP
.I "percent"
Percent of IPs currently in use compared to max.
.TP
.I "touch"
Number of IP's which appear in the lease file, but who's leases have
expired. A touched IP is either expired or abandoned.  The touched IP count
is somewhat misleading when you try to determine if an IP pool is big
enough; it is a better indicator of whether a pool is too large.
.TP
.I "t+c"
The sum of Touched and Currently in-use leases.
.TP
.I "t+c perc"
Percent of IPs either touched or currently in use, compared to max.
.TP
.I "bu"
Failover pair can allocate these addresses. The count appears only if there
is failover configuration.
.TP
.I "bu perc"
Percent of addresses that failover pair can allocate. The percent appears
only if there is failover configuration.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Path to the dhcpd.conf file.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-leases\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Path to the dhcpd.leases file.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sort\fR=\fI[nimcptTe]\fR
Sort ranges by chosen fields as a sorting keys.  Maximum of five sort keys
can be defined.  Keys weight from left to right IE if more weighting keys
are equal next one is used. The IP field is default sort key.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reverse\fR
Sort results in reverse order.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR=\fI[thcxX]\fR
Output format. Currently there is text, html, full-html and csv
(comma-separated values). Default is text. Standard html (h) outputs only
the HTML tables, and is useful for embeding more complex web pages.
Full-html (H) provides complete HTML headers, etc., including in-line CSS.
Output format xml (x) is similar to the dhcpstatus Perl module output. The
extended xml (X) format will print ethernet address details.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIFILE\fR
File where output is written. Default is stdout.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR=\fINR\fR
Limit what will be printed. Syntax is similar to chmod permission string.
The limit string uses two digits which vary between 0 to 7.  The first digit
determines which headers to display, and the second digit determines which
numeric analysis tables to include in the output. The following values are
"OR'd" together to create the desired output. The default is 77.
