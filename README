This is dhcpd-pools which is made for ISC dhcpd pool range analysis.

== Quick start

	./bootstrap
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local
	make
	make install


== General information

	With this command you can check usage of pool addresses
	when address space is great. Command is designed so that
	it will not get slow even there is thousands of IPs in
	lease file. This kind of huge dhcpd installation can be
	near by DSL DSLAMs or some other public access connection
	points.

	This command will not print nice to know information like
	DHCPStatus does. Output is limited only to list only
	usage for ranges, shared network and total address space.
	Limiting what is printed is the right thing to do when
	there is thousands of addresses. If your address space is
	small some other dhcp analyzer might be more suitable for
	you.

== Dependencies to other projects

	http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/

		If you have gnulib checked out somewhere at file
		system you can avoid download by setting
		GNULIB_SRCDIR environment variable.

== Test data wanted

	Maintainer is interested to get copy of your dhcpd.conf
	and dhcpd.leases file, with includes if you use them.
	Intention is to collect large set of data to build
	realistic regression test environment. By giving your
	data to maintainer you can be sure that updates will work
	for you.

	If you are interested to help this way put all files into
	tar.gz, and send them to kerolasa@iki.fi. It would be nice
	that email subject line would have 'dhcpd-pools test data'.
