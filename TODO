### Bugs

Reported-by: Huangyu: I found dhcpd-pools didn't consider if the
   active lease's ends time is passed so it would still think the
   lease is active even if dhcpd daemon is stopped for a long time,
   the leases marked by "active" state in lease_file has expired in
   fact.

### Feature requests

o Assigned IPs count (Nelson)
o Subnet counting class (Henryk)
o When time stamps are part of lease situation evaluation (see
  bug 1) add a --now switch which will one can use to change when
  expiry happens.
o Add lease time histogram support.

### Next major version

1  Well structured code, with extendible sane architecture.
2  Server, which has analysis in cache for N seconds and will
   answer via socket.
3  Configuration file for server.
4  State file, where different ranges, shared networks etc have
   unique identifiers (needed for graphs).
5  Support for snmp and munin protocols.
6  SNMP traps when limits get exceeded.
7  Some clever check_dhcpd_pools binary for Nagios & other
   monitoring software.

8  Super server support, which will collect analysis from other
   dhcpd-pool servers.
9  Nice http view interface on super server, much can be copied
   from http://piwik.org/
10 And some other things perhaps...

When items 1-7 are done v3 can be released. To support rewrite
there should be a design document with nice blue print, which is
a web page.
