### Bugs

> 1. from huangyu: china,fujian province,fuzhou
>
> according to my observation, every lease,for example,ip
> 192.168.0.123 perhaps appears many times in dhcpd.leases,but
> only the last time's state is the final valid state of this ip
> 192.168.0.123.
>
> No matter it appears how many times in dhcpd.leases,and no
> matter it has how many different state in dhcpd.leases. no
> matter it had been assigned to how many different mac-address.
> As long as it's last appearance's binding state is free in
> dhcpd.leases,then ,it's free,in other word,it's not active.
>
> and i notice that if a active lease time expired,dhcpd daemon
> will set this lease's binding state from active to free
> directly,without released state in this period.
>
> in other words, when a lease's binding state "active" follow by
> "free",not follow by "released";dhcpd-pools still think it's
> active.
>
> and another bug maybe is:
>
> i found dhcpd-pools didn't consider if the active lease's ends
> time is passed so it would still think the lease is active even
> if dhcpd daemon is stopped for a long time,the leases marked by
> "active" state in lease_file has expired in fact.

### Feature requests

o IPv6 support (Frank)
o Assigned IPs count (Nelson)
o Subnet counting class (Henryk)

### Next major version

1  Well structured code, with extendible sane architecture.
2  Server, which has analysis in cache for N seconds and will
   answer via socket.
3  Configuration file for server.
4  State file, where different ranges, shared networks etc have
   unique identifiers (needed for graphs).
5  Support for snmp and munin protocols.
6  SNMP traps when limits get exceeded.
7  Some clever check_dhcpd_pools binary for Nagios & other
   monitoring software.

8  Super server support, which will collect analysis from other
   dhcpd-pool servers.
9  Nice http view interface on super server, much can be copied
   from http://piwik.org/
10 IPv6 support.
11 And some other things perhaps...

When items 1-7 are done v3 can be released. To support rewrite
there should be a design document with nice blue print, which is
a web page.
